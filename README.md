Starting My 100 Days of Coding Challenge!

For the next 100 days, I will be committing to coding every single day. My goal is to improve my programming skills, tackle real-world problems, and learn new technologies along the way.

I believe that consistent practice is the key to success, and I canâ€™t wait to see where this challenge takes me. ðŸ™Œ
Iâ€™ll be sharing my progress regularly, including the struggles, the wins, and everything in between. I hope this journey will inspire others to start their own coding challenges or share their experiences!

Letâ€™s make the next 100 days count!
